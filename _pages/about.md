Iâ€™m a third-year CS PhD student at UCLA, fortunate to be advised by [Professor Raghu Meka](https://hackmd.io/@raghum/index). My primary research interest lies in learning theory, where I explore the mathematical foundations of machine learning, aiming to understand and develop principled methods for efficient learning. I am also interested in probability-related aspects of theoretical computer science, particularly in the role of randomness and probabilistic methods in algorithms, complexity theory, and combinatorics. Before that, I received my B.S. in Data Science from Yuanpei College, Peking University.
